This project demonstrates the use of the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-java-integration[Asciidoctor Java integration] library in a Servlet.
The integration is bootstrapped and configured in an application-scoped CDI bean.
The Servlet then invokes that bean to render the AsciiDoc source submitted from a web form.

All of the functionality is tested by http://arquillian.org[Arquillian].
